## Running as Github Action

      - name: Spell Caster
        uses: marsfoundation/spell-caster@action
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          TENDERLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY }}
          TENDERLY_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_PROJECT }}
          TENDERLY_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_USER }}
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

## Developing

```sh
bun fix # to run linter, tests and typecheck
```

### Bun support

GitHub Runners don't support bun as runner environment so we use bun for testing and bundling but not as runtime dependency.

### GH Action

New release of github action (pushed to `action`) branch is done after each commit to `main` branch.
